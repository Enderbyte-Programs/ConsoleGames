How to Mod this program
1. Create code

    1a. Create a new file in enderbyteprograms/consolegames/games
    1b. Use the applicable package statement
    1c. the class must be "public class <NAME> implements Game" so it can be correctly registered.
    1d. The point of execution for your game will be in the function "public static int play()". (Return 0 on sucess, 1 on error)
    1e. It is recommended to surround your play() function in a try-catch and catch ambiguos exceptions just in case. On an ambiguous Exception, return 1 after calling shared.defaultCrashHandler(). This will give a crash message to the user.
    If you need a code example, check out testgame.java.

2. Register game (sadly requires mixins)

    2a. Using mixins, add to the END of the init() funtion in Main
    shared.games.add(new <yourgame>());
    shared.myoptions.add("The Name of Your Game");

3. Register Configurations (requires mixins)

    3a. Using mixins, add to the END of the cfg() function in Main
    REMEMBER: shared.configdat is the Cfile() instance that holds all Configurations
    3b. Check if the config is in the file with shared.configdat.cexists()
    If it doesn't register a new Cnode() with shared.configdat.newNode(). Cnode() is not meant to be standalone. The code is (name,defaultdata,usenum). 
    3c. Once all Configurations are registered, they will automatically appear in the Options menu.
