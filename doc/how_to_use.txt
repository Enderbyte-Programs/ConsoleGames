Consolegame Manual by Enderbyte Programs (c) 1997 [nevermind (c) 2022]

Welcome to ConsoleGames, a customizeable set of games for your console.

=====Execution=====
Execute the program by opening a terminal to the folder of your choice and running "java -jar <Path to disk>/consolegames.jar". On windows this will probably be D:\. For unix, check your mount points.

While the program initializes (usually less than 200 ms), the screen will print: Loading.

=====Main Menu=====
The main menu will prompt you to type an option. 0 is Exit and will safely quit the program returning you to the terminal. 1 will open configuration (SEE OPTIONS).
Numbers 2 and higher each represent a game.

=====Playing=====
When you run a number from the main menu, it will play the game associated with it. If the game crashes, you should be returned to the main menu with the traceback.
Please send the traceback (red text) to the developer

=====Options=====
The options menu contains all of the different options that you can change to your liking. Options are stored in cfg.txt
If you leave the field blank and press enter, the value will not be changed. Values must not contain =:= as this is the seperator.

Choosing save will save to cfg.txt. Choosing cancel will not save your changes.

username: Represents your name. You can set it to anything.

=====Statistics=====
Ths Statistics menu contains all of the statistics about your play. They are automatically saved to a file after every play. Statistics are grouped by game.
